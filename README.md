## 🌦️ Weather Forecasting Using LSTM (Machine Learning)

This project focuses on predicting future weather conditions—specifically **temperature values**—using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** deep learning model. Weather forecasting plays an essential role in agriculture, transportation, disaster management, and daily decision-making. Traditional forecasting methods can struggle with complex, non-linear climate patterns, whereas LSTMs are excellent at understanding time-series data like weather trends.

### 🔍 Project Objective

To build and evaluate an LSTM-based neural network that can learn patterns from historical weather data and accurately forecast future temperature values.

### 📌 Key Features

* Uses **historical weather dataset** for training and testing
* Data preprocessing includes **normalization, handling missing values, and feature scaling**
* Time-series split into sequences for LSTM input format
* Model built using **TensorFlow / Keras**
* Training and validation used to tune prediction performance
* Results visualized through **prediction vs actual** graphs

### 🧠 Model Used

* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network**
* Optimized for sequential data and long-term dependencies

### ✔️ Output

* Predicts future temperature values based on learned trends
* Visual comparison chart showing performance accuracy

### 🎯 Conclusion

The LSTM model demonstrated high capability in capturing temporal weather patterns and produced reliable forecasts. With more features such as humidity, wind speed, and pressure—and a larger dataset—the prediction accuracy could improve even further. This approach can be extended into real-world weather prediction systems.
